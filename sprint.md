**Verification**:
What it is: Verification checks whether the product is being built correctly. It's about making sure that the software meets all the specified requirements before it's released.

**Example**: Imagine you're baking a cake. Verification is like checking the recipe step by stepâ€”making sure you've added the right amount of flour, sugar, and eggs, and that you've baked it for the right amount of time. You're ensuring that everything is done according to the plan.

**Validation**:
What it is: Validation checks whether the right product is being built. It ensures the software works as expected for the user.

**Example**: Continuing with the cake analogy, validation is like tasting the cake. Even if you followed the recipe perfectly, does it taste good? Does it meet the expectations of the person who will eat it? Validation ensures that the final product fulfills the intended purpose.

**In Summary:**
- Verification = Are we building the product right?
- Validation = Are we building the right product?
