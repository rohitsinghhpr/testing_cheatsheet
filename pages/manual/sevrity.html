        <p>Severity and priority are crucial concepts in defect management, helping testers and developers decide how to handle bugs based on their impact on the system and urgency for fixing. Here’s a breakdown with examples:</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="severity"><strong>Severity</strong>:</h3>
<p>Severity indicates the impact a defect has on the system’s functionality. It is often categorized as <strong>Critical, High, Medium, or Low</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Critical Severity</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: A banking app crashes when a user submits a money transfer request. Since this directly affects the core function and users cannot proceed, it’s considered critical.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>High Severity</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: In an e-commerce app, users can add items to the cart, but the checkout button doesn’t work. This issue affects sales functionality, which is crucial for business, but the app is still usable in other areas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Medium Severity</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: A website’s “Contact Us” form doesn’t send emails correctly. This feature isn’t core to business operations, but it impacts communication with users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Low Severity</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: A typo is found in a tooltip on the main page. This issue doesn’t affect functionality and is mostly cosmetic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 id="priority"><strong>Priority</strong>:</h3>
<p>Priority reflects the urgency of fixing a defect, usually determined by business needs and timelines. It’s generally categorized as <strong>High, Medium, or Low</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>High Priority</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: During a product launch, a defect in the payment gateway is discovered. This bug needs to be fixed immediately to avoid impacting sales and customer experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Medium Priority</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: A bug that prevents users from updating their profile pictures. While not urgent, it still needs to be fixed in the upcoming release to improve user experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Low Priority</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: A misalignment in the footer text on certain pages. This issue doesn’t affect the functionality or user tasks and can be scheduled for future releases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 id="combined-examples-of-severity-and-priority"><strong>Combined Examples of Severity and Priority</strong>:</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Critical Severity, High Priority</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: The login feature for a banking app fails, blocking all users. Since login is essential and must work immediately, it’s both high severity and high priority.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>High Severity, Low Priority</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: An internal reporting tool in an accounting software has data inaccuracies, but the tool is only used at the end of the fiscal year. Since it doesn’t affect current usage, the priority is lower, though the issue is serious.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Low Severity, High Priority</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: A spelling error in the product name on the homepage of an e-commerce site. Though it’s a minor issue, it can affect the brand’s image, so it’s given high priority for a quick fix.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Medium Severity, Medium Priority</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: A mobile app feature that lets users sort items doesn’t work. While this issue doesn’t prevent users from accessing content, it’s still important for user experience and should be addressed in a coming release.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Using severity and priority together helps teams efficiently prioritize fixes, ensuring critical issues are resolved promptly while balancing other less urgent fixes.</p>
