      <summary>What is inclusion and exclusion?</summary>
      <div class="content">
        <strong>Inclusion</strong> refers to items, conditions, or features that are explicitly covered or part of the
        testing scope. <strong>Exclusion</strong> defines what is not included, specifying boundaries and limitations.
        For example, in testing an e-commerce site, inclusion might cover the <strong>shopping cart</strong>, while
        exclusion could specify that <strong>payment gateway testing</strong> is out of scope.

        <summary>What is a Library?</summary>
        <div class="content">
          <p>A <strong>Library</strong> is a collection of pre-written code that developers can use to perform common
            tasks or solve specific problems. It provides reusable functions, classes, or modules that can be integrated
            into your own applications. Key points about libraries:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Libraries contain modular, reusable code.</li>
            <li>Developers can avoid reinventing the wheel by leveraging libraries for common functionalities like data
              manipulation, networking, or user interface components.</li>
            <li>Unlike frameworks, libraries do not dictate the structure of an application, allowing more flexibility
              for developers.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What is a Framework?</summary>
        <div class="content">
          <p>A <strong>Framework</strong> is a more comprehensive tool that provides a foundation for developing
            applications. It dictates the structure and design of the application and often includes libraries as part
            of its offering. Key points about frameworks:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Inversion of Control</strong>: Frameworks often implement the principle of inversion of control,
              meaning the framework controls the flow of the application and calls your code at specific points (via
              hooks or callbacks). This is sometimes referred to as the "Hollywood Principle" — "Don't call us, we'll
              call you."</li>
            <li><strong>Built-in Features</strong>: Frameworks provide a broad set of built-in features and tools, which
              can include libraries, but also conventions, patterns, and best practices for structuring applications.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Opinionated</strong>: Frameworks tend to be more opinionated about how an application should be
              designed and structured. They often enforce certain practices and patterns.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <summary>What is Error Seeding?</summary>
        <div class="content">
          <p><strong>Error Seeding</strong> is the process of intentionally adding known errors into a program to
            evaluate the effectiveness of error detection methods and tools. It helps in assessing the skills of testers
            in finding bugs and understanding the reliability of the application. Some key points about error seeding:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>It helps determine the error detection rate by comparing the number of seeded errors found against the
              total number of errors introduced.</li>
            <li>It provides insights into the skill levels of testers and the robustness of the error detection process.
            </li>
            <li>It is useful in estimating the effectiveness of the testing process and can highlight areas where
              improvements are needed.</li>
