        <p>Here are the 7 principles of manual testing explained simply, along with examples to illustrate each one:</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="1-testing-shows-presence-of-defects">1. <strong>Testing Shows Presence of Defects</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Principle</strong>: Testing can prove that bugs exist in a system, but it cannot prove that there are no bugs.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: If a tester finds multiple bugs in a new feature, it indicates defects are present. However, even if all test cases pass, it&#39;s impossible to guarantee there are no hidden issues.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-exhaustive-testing-is-impossible">2. <strong>Exhaustive Testing is Impossible</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Principle</strong>: Testing every possible scenario is impractical due to the vast number of inputs, outputs, and paths. Instead, testers focus on the most critical and common scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: For a login screen, instead of testing all possible combinations of characters in the password, testers might only check common cases like empty input, valid and invalid passwords, and edge cases (like max character length).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-early-testing">3. <strong>Early Testing</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Principle</strong>: Testing should begin as early as possible in the software development lifecycle to find and fix defects sooner, which reduces costs.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Reviewing requirements before development starts can help spot unclear requirements that could lead to defects later, saving time on fixing bugs after development.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="4-defect-clustering">4. <strong>Defect Clustering</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Principle</strong>: Most defects are typically found in a small number of modules or areas. This is often due to code complexity, new features, or other factors.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: In an e-commerce application, if bugs are frequently found in the checkout process, testers will pay more attention to that area during future testing.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="5-pesticide-paradox">5. <strong>Pesticide Paradox</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Principle</strong>: Repeating the same tests will eventually stop finding new defects, much like pests becoming immune to the same pesticide. Tests need to be reviewed and updated regularly to remain effective.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: If a tester uses the same test cases for each software version, eventually those test cases will fail to uncover new defects. Creating new test cases and modifying existing ones helps find fresh issues.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="6-testing-is-context-dependent">6. <strong>Testing is Context Dependent</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Principle</strong>: Testing varies based on the type of application. Different applications require different types of testing approaches, strategies, and techniques.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: A banking app requires high-security and reliability testing, while a social media app might focus more on usability and performance to handle many users.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="7-absence-of-errors-fallacy">7. <strong>Absence of Errors Fallacy</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Principle</strong>: Even if no defects are found, it doesn’t mean the software is ready if it doesn’t meet user needs or if it was built based on incorrect requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Suppose a payroll system was developed and tested without any issues. If it fails to calculate overtime correctly according to company policy, it doesn’t matter that there were no bugs; it’s still unusable for users.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>These principles guide testers in prioritizing efforts, ensuring they focus on creating meaningful, efficient, and effective testing processes.</p>
