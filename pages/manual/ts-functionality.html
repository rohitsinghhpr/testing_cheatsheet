                    requests.</li>
                <li><strong>Cache Expiration:</strong> Test that cached data expires after the predefined time limit and
                    is
                    refreshed from
                    the database.</li>
                <li><strong>Cache Invalidation on Update:</strong> Verify that the cache is invalidated and refreshed

                    is deleted.</li>
                <li><strong>Cache Size Limit:</strong> Test that the cache does not exceed its maximum size and handles
                    evictions
                    correctly.</li>
                <li><strong>Cache Miss Handling:</strong> Verify that the system correctly handles cache misses by
                    retrieving data from

                    improve initial response times.</li>
                <li><strong>Cache Hit Rate:</strong> Verify that the cache hit rate is within acceptable limits,

                    data becomes
                    stale, either by automatic invalidation or notification.</li>
                <li><strong>Cache for Static Assets:</strong> Verify that static assets (e.g., images, CSS, JS files)
                    are
                    cached effectively on
                    the client-side and server-side.</li>
                <li><strong>Cache Control Headers:</strong> Test that the correct cache control headers are sent to the
                    client to manage
                    browser caching behavior.</li>
                <li><strong>Cache Bypass for Logged-In Users:</strong> Ensure that sensitive data, like user-specific

                <li>
                    <strong>Integer Validation:</strong> Test that integer fields correctly handle whole numbers and

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Range Validation:</strong> Verify that numeric fields enforce minimum and maximum value
                    constraints (e.g.,
                    age must be between 0 and 120).

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Overflow Handling:</strong> Ensure that very large numbers (e.g., exceeding the field's
                    capacity) are either
                    truncated or an appropriate error is shown.
                </li>

                    accepted and processed correctly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Scientific Notation:</strong> Verify that fields intended to accept scientific notation
                    (e.g., 1.23e+10) handle it
                    correctly.

                    or removed based on field requirements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Localization:</strong> Verify that numeric input respects locale-specific formatting (e.g.,
                    using periods vs.
                    commas for decimal points).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Validation on Field Focus:</strong> Test that numeric fields are validated when the user
                    moves focus out of
                    the field (e.g., on blur).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Handling of Special Characters:</strong> Ensure that special characters (e.g., currency
                    symbols) are either
                    correctly processed or rejected based on field rules.
