        <h3 id="1-verification">1. <strong>Verification</strong></h3>
        <p> <strong>Definition</strong>: Verification is the process of checking whether the software or system meets
            the
            specifications or requirements. It is often done to ensure that the product was built correctly according to
            the
            design and requirements.</p>
        <p> <strong>Example</strong>: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scenario</strong>: A software developer builds a login page with fields for a username and
                password.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Verification Process</strong>: Verification involves checking if the login page was developed
                according
                to the design specifications. For example, checking if the fields for entering the username and password
                are
                present, if they are correctly labeled, and if the layout matches the design.</li>
            <li><strong>Question it answers</strong>: &quot;Are we building the product right?&quot;</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="2-validation">2. <strong>Validation</strong></h3>
        <p> <strong>Definition</strong>: Validation is the process of checking whether the software or system meets the
            user&#39;s needs and expectations. It ensures that the product does what it is supposed to do, confirming
            its
            correctness from the user&#39;s perspective.</p>
        <p> <strong>Example</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scenario</strong>: A user enters their username and password into the login page and presses
                &quot;Login.&quot;</li>
            <li><strong>Validation Process</strong>: Validation checks whether the login page functions correctly by
                ensuring
                the username and password are validated correctly against the database and the user is redirected to the
                home
                page if the credentials are correct. If the credentials are incorrect, an appropriate error message is
                displayed.</li>
            <li><strong>Question it answers</strong>: &quot;Did we build the right product?&quot;</li>
