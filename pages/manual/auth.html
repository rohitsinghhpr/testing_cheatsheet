        <h3 id="3-authentication"><strong>Authentication</strong></h3>
        <p> <strong>Definition</strong>: Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system.
            It ensures that the entity trying to access the system is who they claim to be.</p>
        <p> <strong>Example</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scenario</strong>: A user attempts to log into a website by entering a username and password.</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication Process</strong>: The system checks if the username and password match those stored in
                the database. If they match, the user is authenticated, and access is granted.</li>
            <li><strong>Example in Action</strong>: Logging into an email account using a username and password or using
                two-factor authentication (e.g., receiving a code on your phone).</li>
            <li><strong>Question it answers</strong>: &quot;Are you who you say you are?&quot;</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="4-authorization"><strong>Authorization</strong></h3>
        <p> <strong>Definition</strong>: Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources or
            actions after the userâ€™s identity has been authenticated. It determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do
            within the system.</p>
        <p> <strong>Example</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scenario</strong>: After logging into a banking application, a user attempts to access their account
                balance.</li>
            <li><strong>Authorization Process</strong>: The system checks whether the authenticated user has permission to view
                the account balance. If the user has sufficient permissions, the system grants access. If not, the user may be
                denied access with an error message like &quot;Insufficient permissions.&quot;</li>
            <li><strong>Example in Action</strong>: A regular user may have access to their own account information, while an
                administrator may have access to all user accounts and settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Question it answers</strong>: &quot;What are you allowed to do?&quot;</li>
