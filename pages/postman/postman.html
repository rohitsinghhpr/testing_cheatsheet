            <summary>Postman Environment and Variables</summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p><strong>Environment Variables:</strong> Postman allows the use of environments to store variables
                    like URLs, authentication tokens, and other data that may change depending on the environment (e.g.,
                    development, staging, production).</p>
                <p><strong>Defining Variables:</strong> You can define variables at the environment or global level.
                    Environment variables are specific to a set of requests, while global variables can be accessed
                    across all collections and environments.</p>
                <p><strong>Examples:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Base URL: <code>{{base_url}}/api/v1/users</code></li>
                    <li>Authorization Token: <code>{{auth_token}}</code></li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Switching Environments:</strong> You can easily switch between different environments by
                    selecting them from the environment dropdown at the top right corner of the Postman window.</p>

            <summary>Postman Collections</summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p><strong>What is a Collection?</strong> A collection in Postman is a group of related requests that
                    are organized together. It is used to store and share your API tests and requests with your team.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Creating a Collection:</strong> You can create a new collection by clicking on the "New"
                    button and selecting "Collection." Once created, you can add requests to it by clicking on the
                    collection name and selecting "Add Request."</p>
                <p><strong>Organizing Requests:</strong> Requests in a collection can be organized into folders for
                    better management, especially when dealing with large projects.</p>
                <p><strong>Sharing Collections:</strong> Collections can be shared with team members by exporting them
                    or using Postman Workspaces to collaborate in real-time.</p>

            <summary>Postman Tests and Automation</summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p><strong>Writing Tests in Postman:</strong> You can write automated tests for your APIs using
                    JavaScript. These tests are run after each request is sent to verify the response against expected
                    conditions.</p>
                <p><strong>Example Test:</strong></p>
                <pre>
        pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
            pm.response.to.have.status(200);
        });
                </pre>
                <p><strong>Common Assertions:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>pm.response.to.have.status(code);</code> - Verify response status code.</li>
                    <li><code>pm.response.to.have.jsonBody(key);</code> - Verify JSON response body contains a specific
                        key.</li>
                    <li><code>pm.response.to.have.header(name);</code> - Check if a specific header is present in the
                        response.</li>
                    <li><code>pm.response.to.have.body(value);</code> - Verify if the response body contains a specific
                        value.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Running Tests Automatically:</strong> Postman can run collections of tests automatically
                    using the Collection Runner or Newman (the command-line version of Postman).</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p><strong>What is the Collection Runner?</strong> The Collection Runner allows you to run multiple
                    requests in a collection in sequence. It can also be used to execute the same request with different
                    data, such as through CSV or JSON files.</p>
                <p><strong>Running a Collection:</strong> To run a collection, click on the "Runner" button in the top
                    right of the Postman window, select the collection, and click "Start Run."</p>
                <p><strong>Using Data Files:</strong> You can use external data files (CSV or JSON) to parameterize your
                    requests during a run. Postman will automatically run the requests with different sets of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Viewing Results:</strong> After the run, you can view the results, including pass/fail
                    status, response times, and details of each request in the collection.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p><strong>What is a Monitor?</strong> A Postman Monitor is a scheduled service that runs collections at
                    specified intervals to test your APIs continuously, ensuring they are working as expected.</p>
                <p><strong>Setting Up a Monitor:</strong> To create a monitor, navigate to the "Monitor" tab in your
                    collection and set the desired frequency (e.g., hourly, daily). Postman will automatically execute
                    the collection and send notifications on failures.</p>
                <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Monitors are commonly used for:
                <ul>
                    <li>API uptime monitoring</li>
