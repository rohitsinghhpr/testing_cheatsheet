            <summary>TDD (Test-Driven Development)</summary>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests
                    are written before the actual code. The process typically follows these steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Write a Test:</b> Define a test for a new feature or functionality.</li>
                    <li><b></b>Run the Test:</b> Initially, the test will fail because the functionality hasn’t been
                        implemented yet.</li>
                    <li><b></b>Write the Code:</b> Implement the minimum amount of code needed to make the
                        test pass.</li>
                    <li><b></b>Run the Test Again:</b> Check if the new code makes the test pass.</li>
                    <li><b></b>Refactor:</b> Clean up the code while ensuring the test still passes.</li>
                    <li><b></b>Repeat:</b> Continue this cycle for each new feature or improvement.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>TDD encourages writing tests that are focused on specific behaviors and helps
                    ensure that code meets its requirements from the beginning.</p>

            <summary>BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)</summary>
            <div class="content">
                BDD extends TDD by focusing on the behavior of the application from the perspective of its users. In
                BDD, tests are written in plain language, typically using the Gherkin syntax, and often include examples
                in the form of "Given-When-Then":
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Given:</strong> A starting condition or context.</li>
                    <li><strong>When:</strong> The action or event that occurs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Then:</strong> The expected outcome or result.</li>
                </ul>
                BDD encourages collaboration among developers, testers, and non-technical stakeholders to ensure that
                the software meets business requirements.

            <div class="content">
                <p>Behavior-Driven Testing (BTT) is often associated with Behavior-Driven
                    Development (BDD), which emphasizes collaboration between developers,
                    testers, and non-technical stakeholders. The goal is to write tests that clearly
                    describe the behavior of the application from the end-user’s perspective. BDD
                    involves:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Writing Scenarios:</b> Use natural language to describe the behavior of the
                system in specific scenarios.</li>
                <li><b>Automating Scenarios:</b> Convert these scenarios into automated tests, often
                using tools like Cucumber or SpecFlow.</li>
                <li><b>Collaboration:</b> Engage stakeholders to ensure the scenarios accurately reflect
                the desired behavior.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>BTT helps bridge the gap between technical and non-technical team members
                    and focuses on ensuring that the software meets business requirements.</p>

            <summary>DDT (Data-Driven Testing)</summary>
            <div class="content">
                DDT is a testing methodology where test data is separated from the test logic. It allows the same test
                case to be executed multiple times with different sets of input data. This approach is useful for
                testing a wide range of inputs or scenarios without duplicating code.
                DDT is commonly used in scenarios like:
                <ul>
                    <li>Validating different user input combinations.</li>
                    <li>Ensuring that the system behaves correctly with various edge cases.</li>
                    <li>Testing system performance under different conditions.</li>
                </ul>
                Tools like JUnit and TestNG support DDT by allowing test data to be provided in external files like CSV,
                XML, or databases.
