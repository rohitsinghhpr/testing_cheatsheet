                <p><strong>Agile</strong> is a project management and software development approach that emphasizes
                    flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. Unlike traditional, linear development
                    methods, Agile breaks projects into smaller, iterative cycles called "sprints" or "iterations,"
                    allowing for frequent reassessment and adaptation. Here are some key elements of Agile:</p>
                <hr>
                <h3 id="core-principles-of-agile"><strong>Core Principles of Agile:</strong></h3>
                <p>Agile is based on the <strong>Agile Manifesto</strong> (2001), which outlines four core values and
                    twelve principles to guide development teams toward more efficient, adaptive, and customer-focused
                    processes:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Responding to Change over Following a Plan</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <hr>
                <h3 id="how-agile-works"><strong>How Agile Works:</strong></h3>
                <p>Agile frameworks, like <strong>Scrum</strong>, <strong>Kanban</strong>, and <strong>Extreme
                        Programming (XP)</strong>, follow similar concepts but have unique methods for planning,
                    tracking, and execution. </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Iterative Development</strong>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Agile breaks the project into small, manageable units (sprints), usually lasting 1-4
                                weeks. Each sprint aims to deliver a working piece of software that adds functionality.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Frequent Feedback</strong>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>At the end of each sprint, teams demonstrate the completed work to stakeholders and
                                gather feedback. This helps refine requirements and ensure the final product meets
                                customer expectations.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Collaboration and Communication</strong>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Agile fosters close collaboration among team members and stakeholders through regular
                                stand-up meetings, planning sessions, and reviews, ensuring transparency and alignment.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Adaptability</strong>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Agile welcomes changing requirements, even late in development. By working in small
                                increments, teams can adapt to changes, refine priorities, and improve the product
                                progressively.</li>

            <div class="content">
                <p>Scrum is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex projects, particularly
                    in software development. It is based on iterative progress, collaboration, and continual
                    improvement. Here's an overview of the key terms in Scrum:</p>
                <hr>
                <h3 id="1-scrum-team-roles">1. <strong>Scrum Team Roles</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Product Owner</strong>: Responsible for maximizing the product's value by managing the
                        Product Backlog and prioritizing work items. The Product Owner acts as the main point of contact
                        between the team and stakeholders.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scrum Master</strong>: Serves as the facilitator for the team, ensuring Scrum practices
                        are followed. The Scrum Master helps remove obstacles and supports team productivity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Developers (Team Members)</strong>: The team members who build the product. In a Scrum
                        Team, they are cross-functional, meaning they have the diverse skills needed to deliver
                        potentially shippable increments.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr>
                <h3 id="2-artifacts">2. <strong>Artifacts</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Product Backlog</strong>: A prioritized list of features, improvements, bug fixes, and
                        tasks needed to build and improve the product. The Product Owner manages this list, continuously
                        refining and prioritizing items.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sprint Backlog</strong>: A subset of the Product Backlog that the team commits to
                        completing during a Sprint. The Sprint Backlog includes the team’s tasks and goals for the
                        Sprint.</li>
                    <li><strong>Increment</strong>: The sum of all Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint,
                        combined with increments from previous Sprints. Each Increment should be a working version of
                        the product that adds to its overall functionality.</li>
                    <li><strong>Definition of Done (DoD)</strong>: A shared understanding of the criteria that must be
                        met for a product increment to be considered complete, such as passing all tests or meeting
                        coding standards.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr>
                <h3 id="3-events-ceremonies">3. <strong>Events (Ceremonies)</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sprint</strong>: A time-boxed iteration of usually 1-4 weeks where the team works on
                        selected items from the Product Backlog to create an Increment. Each Sprint aims to produce a
                        potentially releasable product increment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sprint Planning</strong>: A meeting at the start of each Sprint where the team defines
                        the Sprint Goal and selects the work (Sprint Backlog) they aim to complete by the end of the
                        Sprint.</li>
                    <li><strong>Daily Scrum (Stand-Up)</strong>: A 15-minute daily meeting where team members quickly
                        discuss their progress, any obstacles, and their plans for the day. This keeps the team aligned
                        and identifies any potential issues early.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sprint Review</strong>: A meeting held at the end of the Sprint where the team
                        demonstrates the work they completed to stakeholders, gathering feedback and discussing the
                        product's next steps.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sprint Retrospective</strong>: A session after each Sprint where the team reflects on
                        what went well, what didn’t, and how they can improve processes for the next Sprint.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="4-key-terms-in-scrum">4. <strong>Key Terms in Scrum</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sprint Goal</strong>: A concise statement that defines the objective of the Sprint. It
                        provides the team with a focus and purpose for that Sprint.</li>
                    <li><strong>Velocity</strong>: A measure of the amount of work a team completes in a Sprint, usually
                        represented in story points or completed items. Velocity helps teams estimate future Sprint
                        capacities.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Story</strong>: A simple, high-level description of a requirement from the
                        end-user's perspective. User stories usually follow the format "As a [user], I want [feature] so
                        that [benefit]."</li>
                    <li><strong>Epic</strong>: A large user story that can’t be completed in one Sprint and is typically
                        broken down into smaller user stories or tasks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Burndown Chart</strong>: A graphical representation of the remaining work in the Sprint
                        Backlog over time. It helps the team visualize progress and predict whether they will complete
                        their Sprint Goal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Backlog Refinement (Grooming)</strong>: An ongoing activity where the Product Owner and
                        team review the Product Backlog, clarify items, and re-prioritize as needed. This helps ensure
                        the backlog is always up-to-date and ready for Sprint Planning.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Inspect and Adapt</strong>: Scrum is built on transparency, inspection, and adaptation.
                        The team continually inspects their work and processes (through the Daily Scrum, Sprint Review,
                        and Retrospective) and adapts to improve.</li>
                    <li><strong>Time-Boxing</strong>: Each Scrum event has a fixed duration (or time box), which
                        encourages efficiency and helps maintain a rhythm.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Scrum promotes transparency so all stakeholders and team members
                        have a clear understanding of progress, goals, and impediments.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Story Points</strong>: A unit for estimating the effort required to complete a user
                        story. Story points reflect the complexity and effort rather than time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical Debt</strong>: Accumulated suboptimal code or workarounds that may need to be
                        refactored later to maintain product quality.</li>
                    <li><strong>Impediment</strong>: Any obstacle that prevents the team from progressing or achieving
                        the Sprint Goal. The Scrum Master’s role includes removing these impediments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spike</strong>: A research task that allows the team to explore a concept or reduce
                        uncertainty. It is usually time-boxed and often does not produce a product increment.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="7-scaling-scrum">7. <strong>Scaling Scrum</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scrum of Scrums</strong>: A coordination meeting for multiple Scrum Teams working on the
                        same product to synchronize progress and resolve cross-team dependencies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)</strong>: An approach that incorporates Scrum principles
                        into larger organizations, allowing multiple teams to work collaboratively on complex products.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Nexus</strong>: A framework to scale Scrum with 3-9 Scrum Teams working on a single
                        product, focusing on resolving integration challenges.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr>
                <p>Scrum’s focus on collaboration, continuous feedback, and incremental improvements has made it one of
                    the most widely adopted Agile frameworks.</p>
