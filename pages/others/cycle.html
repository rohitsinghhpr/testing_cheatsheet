            <div class="content">
                The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that guides the development of
                software. It consists of distinct phases, ensuring that software is developed in a systematic,
                efficient, and predictable manner. The typical phases of SDLC are:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Requirement Gathering and Analysis</strong>: Understanding and documenting the
                        requirements from stakeholders.</li>
                    <li><strong>Design</strong>: Creating software architecture, system design, and UI/UX design.</li>
                    <li><strong>Implementation (Coding)</strong>: Writing the actual code based on the design.</li>
                    <li><strong>Testing</strong>: Verifying the softwareâ€™s functionality, performance, and security.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Deployment</strong>: Releasing the software to users or production environments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintenance</strong>: Addressing bugs, updating the software, and improving it
                        post-release.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="content">
                An SDET is a role focused on both software development and quality assurance. SDETs are responsible for
                creating test frameworks, automating test cases, and ensuring that the product meets quality standards
                through both manual and automated testing. Their role integrates the following:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Test Automation Development</strong>: Building test automation scripts and frameworks to
                        increase test efficiency and coverage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaboration with Developers</strong>: Working closely with developers to ensure
                        testability of code and integrating testing into the development process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance and Security Testing</strong>: Ensuring that software performs well under
                        load and is secure from vulnerabilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Continuous Integration</strong>: Implementing automated tests into the CI/CD pipeline
                        for continuous validation of code changes.</li>
                </ul>

            <summary>Bug Life Cycle</summary>
            <div class="content">
                The Bug Life Cycle, also known as the Defect Life Cycle, defines the various stages a bug goes through
                from identification to resolution. Here are the common stages:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>New</strong>: The bug is reported but not yet confirmed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Assigned</strong>: A developer is assigned to investigate and fix the bug.</li>
                    <li><strong>Open</strong>: The developer starts working on the bug fix.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fixed</strong>: The developer has fixed the bug and it is ready for testing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Retesting</strong>: The QA team tests the fix to ensure the bug is resolved.</li>
                    <li><strong>Verified</strong>: The QA confirms that the bug is fixed and no longer present.</li>
                    <li><strong>Closed</strong>: The bug is marked as resolved and the issue is considered closed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reopened</strong>: If the bug persists after being marked as fixed, it may be reopened
                        for further investigation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Defect status [NAFCRR]</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>new</strong> - when a new defect is logged and posted for the first time.</li>
                    <li><strong>assigned</strong> - once the bug is posted by tester, the lead (TL) of tester approves
                        the bug and assign the bug to the developer team.</li>
                    <li><strong>open</strong> - the developer starts analyzing and works on the defect.</li>
                    <li><strong>pending retest</strong> - fixed defect dev gives to qa.</li>
                    <li><strong>retest</strong> - check weather the defect is fixed or not.</li>
                    <li><strong>verified</strong> - the tester re-tests the bug after it got fixed by the dev. if there
                        is no bug detected in soft, then the bug is fixed and status assigned is verified.</li>
                    <li><strong>reopen</strong> - if the the bug persists even after the developer has fixed the bug,
                        the tester changes the status to "reopened". then once again the bug goes through life cycle.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>closed</strong> - if bug is no longer exits then tester assign the status "closed".</li>
                    <li><strong>duplicate</strong> - if the defect is repeated twice.</li>
                    <li><strong>rejected</strong> - if dev feels the defect is not a geniue defect.</li>
                    <li><strong>deferred</strong> - if the present bug is not a prime priority and if it is expected to
                        get fixed in the next release.</li>
                    <li><strong>not a bug</strong> - if bug does not affect the functionality of the app then status
                        assigned to a bug is "not a bug"</li>
                </ul>
