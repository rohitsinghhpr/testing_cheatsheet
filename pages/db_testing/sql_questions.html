            <summary>What is SQL?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate
                relational databases. It allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete data from database tables.

            <summary>What are the different types of SQL commands?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                SQL commands are categorized into:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>DDL (Data Definition Language):</strong> CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE</li>
                    <li><strong>DML (Data Manipulation Language):</strong> SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE</li>
                    <li><strong>DCL (Data Control Language):</strong> GRANT, REVOKE</li>
                    <li><strong>TCL (Transaction Control Language):</strong> COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What is a primary key?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                A primary key is a column (or set of columns) in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that
                table. Primary keys must contain unique values, and null values are not allowed.
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                The <strong>WHERE</strong> clause is used to filter rows before grouping, while the
                <strong>HAVING</strong> clause is used to filter groups after the <code>GROUP BY</code> operation. For
                example:
                <pre><code class="language-sql">
                    SELECT department, COUNT(*)
                    FROM employees
                    WHERE salary > 50000
                    GROUP BY department
                    HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
                </code></pre>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What is normalization?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                Normalization is the process of organizing database tables to reduce redundancy and improve data
                integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller ones and defining relationships between them.
                Common forms of normalization include 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, and BCNF.
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What is a JOIN in SQL?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                A JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Types of
                JOINs include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>INNER JOIN:</strong> Returns records with matching values in both tables.</li>
                    <li><strong>LEFT JOIN:</strong> Returns all records from the left table and matching records from
                        the right table.</li>
                    <li><strong>RIGHT JOIN:</strong> Returns all records from the right table and matching records from
                        the left table.</li>
                    <li><strong>FULL OUTER JOIN:</strong> Returns all records when there is a match in either table.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What is an index in SQL?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                An index is a database object that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table. It
                creates an entry for each value, enabling faster searches. However, indexes can slow down insert and
                update operations.
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What are constraints in SQL?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                Constraints are rules enforced on data in tables to ensure accuracy and integrity. Common constraints
                include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>NOT NULL:</strong> Ensures a column cannot have a NULL value.</li>
                    <li><strong>UNIQUE:</strong> Ensures all values in a column are unique.</li>
                    <li><strong>PRIMARY KEY:</strong> Combines NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints.</li>
                    <li><strong>FOREIGN KEY:</strong> Ensures data consistency between related tables.</li>
                    <li><strong>CHECK:</strong> Ensures values meet a specific condition.</li>
                    <li><strong>DEFAULT:</strong> Assigns a default value to a column.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>DELETE:</strong> Removes specific rows from a table based on a condition. It is a DML
                        command and can be rolled back.</li>
                    <li><strong>TRUNCATE:</strong> Removes all rows from a table without logging individual row
                        deletions. It is a DDL command and cannot be rolled back.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What is a subquery?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                A subquery is a query nested within another query. It is used to perform operations that depend on the
                result of the outer query. Example:
                <pre><code class="language-sql">
                    SELECT name
                    FROM employees
                    WHERE department_id = (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE name = 'Sales');
                </code></pre>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What is a FOREIGN KEY?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                A FOREIGN KEY is a column (or set of columns) in a table that establishes a link between data in two
                tables. It ensures referential integrity by enforcing that a value in the column must match a value in
                the referenced column of another table.
                <pre><code class="language-sql">
                CREATE TABLE orders (
                    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
                    customer_id INT,
                    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
                );
                </code></pre>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What are aggregate functions in SQL?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                Aggregate functions perform calculations on multiple rows of data and return a single value. Common
                aggregate functions include:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>COUNT():</strong> Counts the number of rows.</li>
                    <li><strong>SUM():</strong> Calculates the total of a numeric column.</li>
                    <li><strong>AVG():</strong> Calculates the average of a numeric column.</li>
                    <li><strong>MAX():</strong> Returns the maximum value in a column.</li>
                    <li><strong>MIN():</strong> Returns the minimum value in a column.</li>
                </ul>
                Example:
                <pre><code class="language-sql">
                SELECT department_id, COUNT(*), AVG(salary)
                FROM employees
                GROUP BY department_id;

        <details>
            <summary>What is a view in SQL?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL query. It allows users to simplify complex
                queries and provide security by restricting access to specific data. Views do not store data themselves.
                <pre><code class="language-sql">
                CREATE VIEW high_salary_employees AS
                SELECT name, department, salary
                FROM employees
                WHERE salary > 100000;
                
                SELECT * FROM high_salary_employees;

                The GROUP BY clause groups rows with the same values into summary rows. It is commonly used with
                aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), and MIN().
                <pre><code class="language-sql">
                SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary

            <summary>What is a self join?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                A self join is a regular join where a table is joined with itself. It is useful for comparing rows
                within the same table.
                <pre><code class="language-sql">
                SELECT a.employee_id AS emp1, b.employee_id AS emp2, a.manager_id
                FROM employees a
                INNER JOIN employees b ON a.manager_id = b.employee_id;

            <summary>What is the difference between COALESCE() and ISNULL()?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>COALESCE():</strong> Returns the first non-NULL value from a list of expressions. It
                        supports multiple arguments.</li>
                    <li><strong>ISNULL():</strong> Replaces NULL with a specified replacement value. It supports only
                        two arguments and is specific to some databases like SQL Server.</li>
                </ul>
                Example:
                <pre><code class="language-sql">
                SELECT COALESCE(NULL, NULL, 'Fallback Value') AS result;
                SELECT ISNULL(NULL, 'Fallback Value') AS result; -- SQL Server specific

            <summary>What is the purpose of the CASE statement in SQL?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                The CASE statement provides conditional logic within a query. It allows you to implement IF-THEN-ELSE
                logic.
                <pre><code class="language-sql">
                SELECT name, salary,

            <summary>What is the purpose of the EXISTS clause?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                The EXISTS clause is used to test for the existence of rows in a subquery. It returns TRUE if the
                subquery returns one or more rows.
                <pre><code class="language-sql">
                SELECT name
                FROM employees e

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>DELETE:</strong> Removes specific rows from a table. It is a DML command and can be
                        rolled back.</li>
                    <li><strong>DROP:</strong> Deletes an entire table, including its structure. It is a DDL command and

            <summary>What is the purpose of indexing in SQL?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                Indexing is used to speed up data retrieval by creating a data structure that allows quick lookups.
                However, it may slow down write operations like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE due to additional
                maintenance.
                <pre><code class="language-sql">
                CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name ON employees(name);
