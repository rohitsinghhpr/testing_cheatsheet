// SQL Aggregate Functions - An aggregate function is a function that performs a calculation on a set of values, and returns a single value.
// Aggregate functions ignore null values (except for COUNT()).

MAX() - returns the largest value within the selected column
MIN() - returns the smallest value within the selected column
COUNT() - returns the number of rows in a set
SUM() - returns the total sum of a numerical column
AVG() - returns the average value of a numerical column
SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.

-- JOIN Clause:
-- Used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
-- Types of JOINS: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN.

-- INNER JOIN: Returns only matching rows from both tables
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;

-- LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the left table, and matched rows from the right table.
-- If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;

-- RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the right table, and matched rows from the left table.
-- If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
RIGHT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;

-- FULL OUTER JOIN: Returns rows when there is a match in either left or right table.
SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;

-- GROUP BY Clause:
-- Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "Total Count" or "Average".
-- Often used with aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), etc.

-- Example: Get the number of orders for each customer
SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(OrderID) AS OrderCount
FROM Orders
GROUP BY CustomerID;

-- Example: Get the total order amount for each customer (assuming a 'TotalAmount' column in Orders table)
SELECT CustomerID, SUM(TotalAmount) AS TotalSpent
FROM Orders
GROUP BY CustomerID;

-- HAVING Clause:
-- Used to filter records after the GROUP BY operation. The HAVING clause is similar to WHERE, but WHERE cannot be used with aggregate functions.
-- HAVING filters rows after the aggregation, whereas WHERE filters rows before aggregation.

-- Example: Get customers who have placed more than 5 orders.
SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(OrderID) AS OrderCount
FROM Orders
GROUP BY CustomerID
HAVING COUNT(OrderID) > 5;

-- Example: Get customers who spent more than $500 (assuming a 'TotalAmount' column in Orders table)
SELECT CustomerID, SUM(TotalAmount) AS TotalSpent
FROM Orders
GROUP BY CustomerID
HAVING SUM(TotalAmount) > 500;
