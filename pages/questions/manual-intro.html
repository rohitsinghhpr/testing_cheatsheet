                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Documentation and Test Reporting:</strong> At the end of the day or when I complete a
                            round of testing, I update the test cases with results (pass, fail, blocked) and write
                            reports summarizing my progress. These reports might include details about the test
                            coverage, the number of bugs found, and the severity of defects. I share these reports with
                            stakeholders, including developers, project managers, and product owners.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Exploratory Testing:</strong> If I have some extra time or if no new features are
                            ready for testing, I often perform exploratory testing. This helps identify potential issues
                            that might not be covered by the planned test cases, ensuring that we capture edge cases and
                            unexpected behaviors.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>End of Day:</strong> &quot;By the end of the day, I check for any updates on the bugs I’ve
                    reported and coordinate with the team to plan the next day’s testing activities. I always ensure
                    that my test progress is documented and communicated to the team, so everyone is aware of the
                    current testing status.&quot;</p>

                            testing to ensure that new changes hadn’t introduced any bugs into the existing
                            functionalities.&quot;</p>
