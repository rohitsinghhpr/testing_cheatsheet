                <summary>What techniques and tools do you use to keep yourself organized?</summary>
                <div class="content">I use a combination of tools like JIRA and Trello for task management, which help
                    prioritize and track progress. I also maintain a checklist for daily tasks and set reminders on
                    tools like Outlook or Google Calendar for upcoming deadlines. For larger projects, I break down
                    tasks into manageable steps, set milestones, and use version control tools like Git to keep track of
                    changes and updates.</div>

                    JIRA to organize tasks and prioritize those with high importance or quick turnaround times. I also
                    communicate with stakeholders to confirm priorities if multiple deadlines overlap and make
                    adjustments based on feedback.</div>

                <summary>Tell me about a time when you failed.</summary>
                <div class="content">In one of my previous projects, I underestimated the time required to automate a
                    set of complex test cases and missed the deadline. Although the team was supportive, I felt I could
                    have done a better job estimating the effort. From this experience, I learned the importance of
                    detailed planning, especially for complex tasks, and I now focus on setting more realistic timelines

                <div class="content">Yes, I’ve made mistakes, and I view them as valuable learning experiences. For
                    example, I once missed updating a locator in an automated test script after a minor UI change, which
                    led to failed test runs. Once I identified the issue, I corrected the locator and added checks to
                    avoid similar issues in the future.</div>

                <summary>What is your biggest regret and why?</summary>
                <div class="content">My biggest regret is not starting to focus on automation testing sooner in my
                    career. I initially focused primarily on manual testing, and I realized later that automation could
                    have saved me a lot of time and added more value to my projects. Since then, I’ve prioritized
                    learning automation and upskilling, which has significantly improved my productivity and impact.

                    hear, I took it as constructive feedback. I worked on improving the scripts by implementing better
                    locators and adding dynamic waits, which made the tests more reliable. This experience taught me the
