                <summary>1. Tell me about your projects, backend/frontend tech used, manual/automation.</summary>
                <div class="content">
                  <p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong> "In my recent project, I developed a hashtag search and copy tool for social media users. On the <strong>backend</strong>, I used Spring Boot with a REST API, and for the <strong>frontend</strong>, we chose React for its component-based architecture, which made it easier to handle state and build reusable UI elements. For <strong>testing</strong>, I primarily focused on <strong>automation</strong>, using Selenium and REST Assured for UI and API testing respectively. I also wrote unit tests in <strong>JUnit</strong> to ensure our service layer functions were reliable and conducted some <strong>manual testing</strong> for edge cases not covered by automation."</p>

                <div class="content">
                  <p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong> "I perform various types of testing, including:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Unit Testing</strong>: Using JUnit and Mockito to verify individual components.</li>
                    <li><strong>Integration Testing</strong>: To ensure different services communicate as expected.</li>
                    <li><strong>End-to-End Testing</strong>: Using Selenium for UI workflows and REST Assured for API validation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance Testing</strong>: Using JMeter to measure response times and system stability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regression Testing</strong>: To confirm that new changes do not break existing functionality.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Acceptance Testing (UAT)</strong>: Ensuring the application meets business requirements before final approval."</li>

                <summary>3. Defect management tool and test management tool?</summary>
                <div class="content">
                  <p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong> "For defect management, I primarily use <strong>JIRA</strong> to log, track, and manage issues. It’s beneficial for assigning issues to specific team members and setting priorities. For test management, I use <strong>TestRail</strong>, which helps document test cases, record results, and generate reports for overall test coverage and pass/fail rates."</p>

                <div class="content">
                  <p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong> "Yes, I follow agile methodology in my projects. We have bi-weekly sprints with daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress and blockers. Each sprint includes planning, where we define user stories, followed by development and testing phases. At the end of each sprint, we conduct a retrospective to discuss what went well and areas for improvement."</p>

                <div class="content">
                  <p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong> "Our end-to-end testing process involves:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Requirement Analysis</strong>: Reviewing requirements and user stories to understand the scope.</li>
                    <li><strong>Test Planning</strong>: Defining the testing strategy, resource allocation, and timelines.</li>
                    <li><strong>Test Case Development</strong>: Writing test cases based on acceptance criteria.</li>
                    <li><strong>Environment Setup</strong>: Preparing the testing environment and required tools.</li>
                    <li><strong>Test Execution</strong>: Running test cases, both manually and automated, and recording results.</li>
                    <li><strong>Defect Reporting</strong>: Logging any bugs found in JIRA and assigning severity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Re-Testing and Regression Testing</strong>: Ensuring fixes work and don’t impact existing functionality.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sign-off</strong>: After all tests pass, providing approval for release."</li>

                <div class="content">
                  <p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong> "For estimation, I break down each feature into smaller tasks and estimate each based on complexity and past experience. I use <strong>story points</strong> to assess effort and allocate a buffer for unexpected issues. For automation, I also estimate time for script development, review, and execution."</p>

                <div class="content">
                  <p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong> "One critical defect I found involved the API <strong>rate-limiting</strong> feature, which wasn’t working as intended. This allowed users to exceed the intended request limits, which could have led to performance issues and excessive server load. I reported the issue, and the development team implemented a fix to throttle requests properly."</p>

                <div class="content">
                  <p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong> "I suggested an enhancement to implement <strong>lazy loading</strong> on the hashtag search results page. Originally, all results were loaded at once, leading to slow load times. Implementing lazy loading significantly improved the user experience by reducing initial load times, especially for mobile users."</p>

                <div class="content">
                  <p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong> "I ensure regression issues are minimized by maintaining a robust <strong>automated regression suite</strong> that covers critical functionalities. This suite is executed with every release. I also make sure to update the test suite when new features are added or existing features are changed."</p>

                <div class="content">
                  <p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong> "If a bug is found after sign-off, I analyze the root cause and check if it was due to incomplete test cases or missed edge scenarios. I then update our test cases to include that scenario to prevent future occurrences. I also discuss it in our <strong>sprint retrospective</strong> to avoid similar issues in upcoming stories."</p>

                <div class="content">
                  <p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong> "Our release cycle includes several phases:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Staging</strong>: Here, automated tests are run on a near-production environment to catch any last-minute issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>QA</strong>: The QA team performs thorough testing, including regression and smoke tests.</li>
                    <li><strong>UAT (User Acceptance Testing)</strong>: Conducted by business users to validate the product meets their requirements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Beta Testing</strong>: A limited release to end-users to identify real-world issues. Automation scripts are also run here to verify core functionalities.</li>
