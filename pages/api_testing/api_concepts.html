            <summary>What is the difference between SOAP and REST APIs?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):</strong> A protocol that uses XML for request and
                        response messages. It is more rigid and requires strict standards.</li>
                    <li><strong>REST (Representational State Transfer):</strong> An architectural style that uses
                        standard HTTP methods and supports multiple formats like JSON, XML, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                Example of a REST request:
                <pre><code class="language-http">
                POST /api/v1/employees HTTP/1.1
                Host: example.com
                Content-Type: application/json

                    <li><strong>Functional Testing:</strong> Validates that the API performs as expected according to
                        requirements (e.g., correct responses for valid inputs).</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-Functional Testing:</strong> Tests the performance, reliability, scalability, and
                        security of the API.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What are API test cases?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                API test cases define scenarios to validate the API’s functionality, reliability, and performance.
                Examples include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Verify API response status codes (e.g., 200, 404, 500).</li>
                    <li>Validate the structure and data types in the response body.</li>

        <details>
            <summary>What are API rate limits?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                API rate limits control the number of API requests a client can make in a specific period. This ensures
                fair usage and protects against abuse. Limits can be implemented per user, per application, or per IP
                address.
                Example of a response when rate-limited:
                <pre><code class="language-http">
                HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
                Content-Type: application/json
        
                {
                    "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Try again in 60 seconds."
                }

            <summary>What is API versioning?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                API versioning involves managing changes to an API without breaking existing clients. It allows the
                introduction of new features or updates while maintaining compatibility. Versioning can be done using:
                <ul>
                    <li>URL paths (e.g., /v1/resource).</li>
                    <li>Request headers (e.g., Accept: application/vnd.example.v1+json).</li>
                </ul>
                Example:
                <pre><code class="language-http">
                GET /api/v1/employees HTTP/1.1
                Host: example.com
                </code></pre>

        <details>
            <summary>What is the importance of response time in API testing?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                Response time is crucial in API testing as it indicates how quickly an API can respond to requests. Slow
                response times can lead to poor user experience and performance issues, especially under high load. APIs
                should ideally respond in under 1 second for most use cases.
                Example:
                <pre><code class="language-sql">
                -- Measure the time it takes for the API to respond
                SELECT response_time, request_url
                FROM api_logs
                WHERE response_time > 1; -- Filter for slow responses
                </code></pre>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What is the role of data-driven testing in API testing?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                Data-driven testing involves using a variety of input data to test an API’s functionality. This allows
                testing of multiple scenarios, ensuring that the API performs correctly with different data sets. It can
                be automated to run tests with different combinations of inputs.
                Example:
                <pre><code class="language-sql">
                -- Example: Testing multiple inputs
                SELECT * FROM test_data;
                
                -- Loop over inputs and send API requests for each one
                FOR each input in test_data:
                    -- Execute API request with input data
                </code></pre>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What is the purpose of mocking in API testing?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                Mocking in API testing is used to simulate the behavior of external systems or components. It allows
                testing the API in isolation without needing the actual system to be present or functioning. It can be
                especially useful when third-party services are unavailable or too expensive to call repeatedly.
                Example:
                <pre><code class="language-json">
                {
                    "status": 200,
                    "data": {
                        "user_id": 1,
                        "name": "Mock User"
                    }
                }
                </code></pre>
            </div>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What is the difference between positive and negative API testing?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Positive Testing:</strong> Validates that the API works as expected with valid input and
                        requests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Negative Testing:</strong> Tests how the API handles invalid input or unexpected
                        scenarios, ensuring proper error handling and responses.</li>
                </ul>
                Example of positive test case:
                <pre><code class="language-json">
                {
                    "username": "valid_user",
                    "password": "valid_pass"
                }
                </code></pre>
                Example of negative test case:
                <pre><code class="language-json">
                {
                    "username": "invalid_user",
                    "password": "wrong_pass"
                }

        <details>
            <summary>What are assertions in API testing?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                Assertions are conditions or expressions used in API testing to verify that the API response meets the
                expected criteria. They can check status codes, response bodies, headers, or other aspects of the API
                response.
                Example:
                <pre><code class="language-js">
                // Example of a simple assertion in Postman test script
                pm.test("Status code is 200", function() {
                    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
                });
        
                pm.test("Response time is under 500ms", function() {
                    pm.response.to.have.responseTime.below(500);
                });
                </code></pre>

        <details>
            <summary>What is the role of API documentation?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                API documentation provides developers with detailed information about how to interact with an API. It
                includes endpoints, request/response formats, parameters, authentication methods, and examples. Good API
                documentation ensures that developers can easily understand and use the API.
                Example:
                <pre><code class="language-http">
                GET /api/v1/users HTTP/1.1
                Host: example.com
                Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>
        
                Response:
                200 OK
                {
                    "id": 1,
                    "name": "John Doe",
                    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
                }

        <details>
            <summary>What is the significance of testing API endpoints?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                Testing API endpoints is crucial because each endpoint represents a unique resource or functionality
                within the API. Ensuring each endpoint works as expected helps confirm that the API can fulfill all
                required operations, such as CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
                Example of testing an endpoint:
                <pre><code class="language-http">
                GET /api/v1/products HTTP/1.1
                Host: example.com
                Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>
        
                Response:
                200 OK
                [
                    { "id": 1, "name": "Product A" },
                    { "id": 2, "name": "Product B" }
                ]

            <summary>What is load testing in API testing?</summary>
            <div class="content">
                Load testing in API testing is the process of testing how an API performs under various levels of load
                (e.g., multiple requests per second). It helps determine the API's capacity to handle high traffic and
                identify performance bottlenecks.
                Example using JMeter for load testing:
                <pre><code class="language-http">
                GET /api/v1/items HTTP/1.1
                Host: example.com
                -- Test API with simulated 1000 concurrent users
